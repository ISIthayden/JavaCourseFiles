// Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers (subclasses) to cater for
// a) Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two addition items that can be added.
// The healthy burger can have 6 items (Additions) in total.
// hint:  you probably want to process the two additional items in this new class (subclass of Hamburger),
// not the base class (Hamburger), since the two additions are only appropriate for this new class
// (in other words new burger type).

//  All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger
// plus all additionals, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/final total for the
// burger (base price + all additions)
// For the two additional classes this may require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then
// adding totals to final price.
